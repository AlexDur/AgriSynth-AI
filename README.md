AgriSynth AI is an AI-supported early-warning module that provides the missing nutrition security layer within existing One Health systems. It integrates climate data, vegetation indicators, market prices, and relevant public-health signals to identify emerging sub-national food-security risks before they become visible.

Rather than a standalone monolithic platform, AgriSynth AI is a lightweight, interoperable module that connects seamlessly to national One Health systems through APIs and FHIR-compatible data formats.
